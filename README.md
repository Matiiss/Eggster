Lore?



If you ever encounter a segfault, it was likely caused by Durk the Goose having enough of you poking him. 
Durk resides inside the Easter bunny's head torch and is responsible for turning it on and off 
and gets highly annoyed if you ask it to do it too many times too quickly. 
Rather than replacing Durk the Goose with emotionless mechanized machinery it was decided that 
an external observer would be hired instead so that you can restart where you left off. 
Granted that it managed to write down the latest observations in time.


FAQ (lore):  
(not to be confused with "Lore FAQ")

Q: How come you can play a level again? After all, time is all linear and stuff, morning comes, and you're too late.  
A: Easter Bunny Technologies has developed a special device to solve this issue. It's called "Teleporter 4000", 4000
stands for 4 dimensions in which this machine can travel, the 4th being time. In other words, you get access to a
time machine.

Q: Do tell, how does one get to save so many Easter mornings for so many children? Time do be linear after all.  
A: It's done using a time machine. Refer to "Q: How come you can play a level again? After all, time is all linear 
and stuff, morning comes, and you're too late." for a bit more information.

Q: So, there's a time machine. Why can't the Easter Bunny use it herself? Don't tell me she doesn't have time now...  
A: There's a slight caveat with "Teleporter 4000", an entity can use it only a certain amount of times per year due to
it using special Easter Energy for power. TODO <----
